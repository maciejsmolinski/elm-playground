# Elm Playground

[Elm Language](http://elm-lang.org/) playground repository is supposed to consist of tiny projects that are easy to scan and reason about so that everybody can learn the language quickly by example. More about the project [at the bottom of this readme](#explanation).

Demos: http://elm-playground.maciejsmolinski.com/

## Projects Listing:

Please note [elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be present on your machine to play around with the projects.

### Match Events (WebWorkers and EventSource integration)

* Demo: http://elm-playground.maciejsmolinski.com/match-events/
* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/maciejsmolinski/elm-playground.git && cd elm-playground`
* Install all dependencies, compile and run server: `make matchevents` (or if already installed `make serve-matchevents`)
* View the project [http://localhost:8765/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8765/webpack-dev-server/) in browser
* If you want to use `EventSource`, run node.js server that serves match events in a separate terminal window `cd match-events && node server.js` and uncomment `sse = new Worker('js/sse.js');` in `js/index.js` file to use Server Sent Events by the application

## Explanation

This repository is meant to be a playground so that everybody can learn the language, break things, change things or even improve them.
